# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

1. This is a Next.js App Router project. See
[README.md](README.md) for background on the site, its architecture, and development processes.
2. Use `yarn` as the package manager.
3. Create or update the Jest unit test to have good coverage and to pass for the modified code.
4. If you're updating code in non-minor ways, also run the Cypress e2e test suite via `yarn run cypress` and `yarn build`. It takes several minutes so do it sparingly, such as just targetted tests via commands like `npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/SPEC_FILE_TO_RUN.cy.ts --browser chromium --headless` for the code you changed, and then the full run only if merited (such as large-scale refactoring or core functionality changes).
5. For Cypress e2e tests or other HTTP based testing, try to use my already running dev server on <http://localhost:3000> for testing, but start your own if that isn't running or use `yarn run cypress:run` which starts the server, runs the tests, and then stops the server.
6. We use Prettier for code formatting, which you can run via `yarn format`.
7. Before you say you're done, run `yarn lint && yarn test` to unit test the entire project via Jest, and ensure the l
int run is clean. If your changes are very minor, such as Jest test-only or CSS-only changes, you may skip running the
 Cypress tests.
